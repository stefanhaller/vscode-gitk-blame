# "Show current line in gitk" README

## Features

Provides a single command (`showCurrentLineInGitk`) that opens gitk with the commit that last changed the current line of the current editor window, with that line selected in gitk. From there, you can further drill down into history using gitk's "Show origin of this line" context menu.

## Requirements

This requires a patched version of gitk. Ableton's custom Mac installer for git includes that patch.
